# My Fancy Todos

This project was created in part for me to practice typescript and using Preact Signals for state management. My goal was to keep it simple, clean and readable. It has grown to be a todo app that displays the different effects display options have on content.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Preact Signals
- SASS

## Future Features

The next step will be to add tests so that you can see the effect different display methods have on your testing.

# My Fancy Todos

This project was created in part for me to practice typescript and using Preact Signals for state management. My goal was to keep it simple, clean and readable. It has grown to be a todo app that displays the different effects display options have on content.

Even if the end result looks the same it has quite a big effect on accessibility and should be something you consider when creating web applications.

You will mainly notice the difference if you have a screen reader or you are using the keyboard to navigate the elements or by inspecting the page and checking out the rendered html.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Preact Signals
- SASS

## Future Plans

- Improve the visual of the todo cards.
- Add E2E tests so that you can see the effect different display methods have on your testing. And show how to write tests for different options.
- Setup CI/CD
- Add edit Todo button
- Hover Todo to display the logical order or elements. Maybe use the Todo index & ::before
- Make mobile friendly
